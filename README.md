### ðŸª´ Hi! I'm Mia, a 1st-year Computer Science student at UC Irvine. 

I'm currently learning front-end web development, and I'm interested in applying design techniques that create enjoyable and accessible products as well as helping younger students explore STEM/CS through community outreach events and workshops!
